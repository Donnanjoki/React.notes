>>>. README.md : It is a markdown file that has a large number of helpful tips,
 information and links about the create-react-app that may help you while learning 
 to use the Create React App. It contains a summary of all the commands, like the command 
 to start the react app locally on your system. The information about the start, test, build and eject scripts. 
 For now, it is recommended not to edit the README.md file. As the project advances, you can replace the information 
 in this file with more details about your project.


 >>>. node_modules : This folder includes all the external javascript packages and file packages that are downloaded from 
 npm and are used by your react project. This is rarely opened or changed.


 >>>. .gitignore : The .gitignore is a file that includes some files and directories (environment variables file, or config file and 
    node_modules folder) that your source control - git will not be tracked. The ignored terms include directories that are very large (node_modules) 
    folders or API secrets that you do not need in source control.

>>>. public : This is a folder/ directory that includes all the static assets. It contains some basic HTML, JSON, images, svgs and fonts for our react app. 
These are the roots of your folder.

>>>. src : This is a folder/ directory that includes our react javascript source code of your project. It is where all the react component and pages related code 
will live and is what we will mainly work on to build our app.


>>>. package.json : This file contains the meta-data of our react project, along with it manages our app dependencies. It means all the packages present in the node_modules 
folder for your project, the title of the project, and version number, plus, most important, the scripts that we need to run and build our react app.
