***Obstacles and Roadblocks with using react***
1. React is a library
The react library is small hence only used to cater to a part of the job. In addition to this 
new tools keep emerging hence leaving the developer with a plethora of libraries that may make it impossible to keep up.

2. New ECMAScript Syntax

3. Popularity of Functional Javascript
Though Javascript is not necessarily a functional language, functional techniques can be utilized.
React emphasizes functional programming over object-oriented programming.

4. Javascript Tooling Fatigue
You might love React, but now you also need to be a webpack
expert, handling code splitting, compression, testing, and on and on.

*** React Developer Tools ***
 
1. react-detector 
 Which lets you know which sites are using react and which are not.

2. React Developer Tools 
This is a plugin that can extend the functionality of the browserâ€™s developer tools.
It creates a new tab in the developer tools where you can view React elements.

*** Declaring variables in ES6  ***
Prior to ES6 the only way to declare variables was with var keyword. But with the recent updates
you can declare variables with;

a] const ; Constant is a variable that cannot be changed unlike variables in the past which could be overwritten.
b] let ; with the let keyword we can scope a variable to any code block
by using let we are able to protect the value of the global variable.

** Template String **

This provide us with an alternative to string concatenation.
They also allow us to insert variables into a string.
>>>> unlike traditional string concatenation of string composition;
console.log(lastName + "," + firstName + "" + middleName)
>>>with template strings we can create one string and add on the variables by surrounding them with $
console.log(`${lastName}, ${firstName} ${middleName}`)

Template strings honor whitespaces, which make it easier to draft up email templates, code examples or anything that has white spaces.


**** Default Parameters ***

Note::; Default parameters enable you to initialize a function with default values if arguments are not supplied to the function call. This way it makes ones functions easier to read and less error-prone.
Hence avoiding errors that step from passing in undefined arguments and destructuring objects that don't exist.

**Arrow Functions**
By using the arrow functions you can create functions without using the function keyword.
